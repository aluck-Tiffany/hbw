- Setting up personal AWS account as Management Account using CloudFormation Templates
  Code:
  https://github.com/hbwork/aws-ces-environment/tree/master/aws-msp-environments

Note:
- Create EC2 key pair
- To save running account, it is better deploy an NAT Instance instead of using NAT Gateway which occurs on-going running cost
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html
- Try to automate NAT instance using Terraform code?
- Create IAM user and configure AWS CLI on Linux VM
- Configure AWS Credentials on Linux VM
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html

- Test: Run below command on Linux VM
aws sts get-caller-identity [--profile profilename]
Expected output:
{
    "UserId": "AIDAWEDEMYE4GSAKGIKL3",
    "Account": "421117346104",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::421117346104:user/ericho"
}
